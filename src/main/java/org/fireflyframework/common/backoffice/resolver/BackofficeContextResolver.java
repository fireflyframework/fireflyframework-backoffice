/**
 * Interface for resolving backoffice context with customer impersonation from incoming requests.
 * Implementations are responsible for extracting and enriching context information including:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>backofficeUserId - The actual backoffice/admin user making the request</li>
 *   <li>impersonatedPartyId - The customer (party) being accessed/impersonated</li>
 *   <li>contractId, productId - Business context identifiers</li>
 *   <li>roles and permissions - For both backoffice user and impersonated party</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This is the main entry point for backoffice context resolution with impersonation support.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Expected Headers (Injected by Istio for Backoffice Routes)</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>X-User-Id</code> - Backoffice user UUID (required) - Authenticated backoffice user</li>
 *   <li><code>X-Impersonate-Party-Id</code> - Customer party UUID (required) - Customer being accessed</li>
 *   <li><code>X-Tenant-Id</code> - Tenant UUID (optional) - Can be resolved from party</li>
 *   <li><code>X-Impersonation-Reason</code> - Reason for impersonation (optional, for audit)</li>
 * </ul>
