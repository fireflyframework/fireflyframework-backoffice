/**
 * Immutable backoffice context container for internal portal/backoffice requests.
 * Contains information about the backoffice user performing the action and the customer being impersonated.
 * 
 * <p>This class extends the standard application context with customer impersonation capabilities:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>backofficeUserId</strong>: The actual backoffice/admin user performing the action</li>
 *   <li><strong>impersonatedPartyId</strong>: The customer (party) being impersonated</li>
 *   <li><strong>contractId</strong>: What contract/agreement is being accessed</li>
 *   <li><strong>productId</strong>: What product is being accessed/modified</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>The impersonation is tracked for audit purposes and security validation.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Backoffice systems must send the X-Impersonate-Party-Id header to indicate
 * which customer they are accessing. The X-User-Id header identifies the backoffice user.</p>
